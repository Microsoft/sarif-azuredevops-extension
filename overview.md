**2020 November:** This extension will be deprecated in favor of the [SARIF SAST Scans Tab](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sariftools.scans).

The "SARIF SAST Scans Tab" is a superset of this extension. Where this extension only adds a "Scans" tab to the Build Results page, the "SARIF SAST Scans Tab" adds a "Scans" tab to both the Build Results page and the Work Item page. Functionality is equivalent.

Note: For a SARIF file to be displayed, it must be placed inside an Arifact named "CodeAnalysisLogs".

Feedback is welcome [here](https://github.com/microsoft/sarif-azuredevops-extension/issues).
